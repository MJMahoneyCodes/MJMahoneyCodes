Hi, I am Matt Mahoney. I am currently a Manager in the Research and Development department of Hyland Software. I have been in the position since June of 2018. I currently lead two U.S. Agile development teams, and I am in the process of creating another team in Kolkata, India. My favorite aspect of leadership is watching the people I help grow in their careers. For instance, one of my team  members was interested in changing positions to become a Scrum Master. I worked with him by giving him time to complete the training and guidance on how to improve his influence skills. He was successful and transitioned into that role. 
I am currently attending Cuyahoga Community College for a post-degree certificate in programming and development. I expect to complete the program in May of 2022. I do not have a programming background, so I am taking this coursework to be able to better relate to the software developers and automation test engineers on my team. So far, I have completed coursework in programming logic, MySQL, Python (basic), C# (basic), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and JQuery.
